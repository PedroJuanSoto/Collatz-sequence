# Collatz-sequence

Program in Haskell that produces the polynomial corresponding to a Collatz sequence from the Collatz conjecture to test the existence of certain types of orbits.

It can can also produce the sequence corresponding to the orbit of some integer under the Collatz map for example pluggin in 
10 we get (10,5,16,8,4,2,1).
